# Airplane Crash Analysis

---

# Problem Statement
This internship project focuses on conducting a comprehensive analysis of airplane crashes and fatalities
spanning from 1980 to 2023. The dataset contains crucial information such as crash dates, locations,
operators, flight details, aircraft types, and fatality statistics. The goal is to leverage Power BI for
interactive visualizations and in-depth insights to understand patterns, contributing factors, and trends in
aviation incidents. The analysis aims to provide stakeholders with valuable information for enhancing
aviation safety and mitigating risks.

# Project Objectives:
1. Temporal Analysis:
 - Explore temporal trends in airplane crashes over the years.
 - Identify patterns in the frequency and severity of incidents.
2. Geospatial Analysis:
 - Visualize crash locations on a map to identify hotspots.
 - Analyse the distribution of incidents across different regions.
3. Operator Performance:
 - Evaluate the safety records of different operators and airlines.
 - Identify operators with higher incident rates.
4. Aircraft Analysis:
 - Analyse the involvement of specific aircraft types in incidents.
 - Examine the relationship between aircraft registration and crash occurrences.
5. Fatality Trends:
 - Explore trends in passenger and crew fatalities.
 - Investigate factors contributing to fatalities.
6. Route Analysis:
 - Analyse incident patterns on specific flight routes.
 - Identify routes with a higher likelihood of incidents.

# Results
### Temporal Analysis:
The Temporal analysis revealed fluctuations in the frequency of airplane crashes over the years with notable spikes
and declines observed. That is, 1972 records the highest number of total fatalities (2,796) while 1908 and 1909
records the lowest fatality (1).
The analysis also revealed 16% crew fatalities and 84% passenger fatalities, providing a deeper understanding
of the distribution of fatalities within the aircraft.
